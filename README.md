A small menubar utility that shows the weather as text and expands to conditions upon clicking it. Uses CoreLocation to get your weather for the current location. When the weather changes it will (optionally) pop out of the menu bar to show the current weather. If you choose it can also make subtle ambient noises when it the conditions are stormy.
